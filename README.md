# Quant_seq_analysis
A simple data processing procedure for a S. cerevisiae 3'-end RNA-seq timecourse experiment. Shell scripts for each step of the process are included. Fastqc quality control was performed first. Followed by trimming, alingment, and feature counting. A custom annotation file was included that contains the UTRs for each transcript as determined from PRO-CAP (doi: 10.1101/gr.204578.116) and TIFF-seq (doi: 10.1038/nprot.2014.121).
